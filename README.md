Got it 👍
GitHub automatically shows a **copy button** only when commands are inside proper fenced code blocks.

Right now your commands are plain text, that’s why there’s no copy button.

Use this exact README format instead:

---

# 📦 Frontend Project

## 📂 Installation

Open your terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Development Server

Start the development server using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

After running the command, the application will start locally.

---

✅ Now GitHub will automatically show the **copy button** on the right side of each code block.

---

If you want, I can also make it look more professional with badges, project description, and clean formatting.
